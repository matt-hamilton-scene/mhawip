<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

    <p>I'm Matt, a design focused interdisciplinary engineer currently working in the community energy and energy access sectors. I'm passionate about technology that will enable the transition to a sustainable, equitable, low-carbon economy; and I strive to bring clarity to the projects I work on. Outside of design engineering I enjoy type 2 fun, art, and football. </p>
    <p>I graduated from Imperial College London's <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/school-design-engineering/design-engineering/">MEng Design Engineering</a> program in 2020. I have experience working in the off-grid solar sector, and investigated Circular Economy Solutions for Off-Grid Solar for my master's thesis. In my final year of university I also co-founded <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/school-design-engineering/design-engineering/">Impact Games</a>, a start-up that makes impact driven table top games  </p>
    <p>I'm delighted to currently be working as a Design Engineer at <a href="https://scene.community/">Scene Connect ltd</a>. Scene are an Edinburgh based social enterprise which supports local energy futures through research, consultancy, and product development.</p>
